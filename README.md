Dream Tool
==========

A tool for contemporary interaction design. How is it in 2014 that we are still using print design and presentation software to do software and interaction design? 

We should be able to draw and animate in the same place.

Goals
========
A tool that encourages strategic thinking and allows designers to communicate and integrate into an organization's process.

Features 
=========
(cluster/prioritize this section?)

Create elements in the app (basically, something fairly robust, like Sketch)

Drag and drop animations onto elements

Annotations

Ability to export assets (code, graphics, movies etc)

Set of core animations for common / current interaction design patterns

Ability to add custom screen sizes for things that are not standard. Should already come with current iOS/Android etc screen sizes. These could be managed server-side on a backend when things are no longer valid (?).

Ability for users to create and share new animations

Ability to move elements

Tap targets and animations work on mobile mirroring apps

Artboard names are target names

Export as movie, or ability to mirror and use in real-time on devices

Integration Points
====================
Project Management: estimation and progress tracking, relative to corporate metrics/KPIs
Development: annotated wireframes, asset generation
User Testing: live prototypes

Success Metrics
================
something that gets people to use it organically
